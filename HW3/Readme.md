For this homework assignment I used Google Chrome and Postman to test.

I plug in the 127.0.0.1:3000/basic url in the browser and typed in 'user' for my username and 'pass' for my password,
which then authenticated the request and pulled the information from Github's api website. I then use Postman to receive
the access token with 127.0.0.1:3000/token and then using that bearer token inthe header for 127.0.0.1:3000/oauth2 to gain
access.
