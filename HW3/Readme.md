For this homework assignment I used Google Chrome and Postman to test.

I plug in the 127.0.0.1:3000/basic url in the browser and typed in 'user' for my username and 'pass' for my password,
which then authenticated the request and pulled the information from Github's api website. I then use Postman to receive
the access token with 127.0.0.1:3000/token and then using that bearer token in the header for 127.0.0.1:3000/oauth2 to gain
access. 


**NEW Additions for re-submission**

Attached 'Postman_test.json.postman_collection' is the test I used in Postman. 
Usage:
I saved this collection 'Postman_test.json.postman_collection' to my disk. Then when I open Postman, I clicked on the 'import' link at the top right and uploaded the file, 'Postman_test.json.postman_collection' from my computer. It then loads everything and the test should appear under the 'Collections' tab which should list 'Postman_test' and a drop-down arrow. 

I also attached a text file, 'Question.txt', that answers the question from the homework. 

Thank you!! :-)
